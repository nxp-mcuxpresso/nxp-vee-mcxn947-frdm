/*
 * The MicroUI framework is using an internal buffer to store the inputs events. The event
 * will not be added if the internal events buffer is full. In this case the input driver
 * has to adapt itself in order to not send a future invalid event. For instance, if a
 * PRESSED event is not sent, the input driver has not to send a REPEAT or RELEASE event.
 * So it may have a distinction between the real input state and the "software" input
 * state.
 *
 * When an event has not been managed because the system events queue is full:
 * - increase the size of the system events queue (see Memory page of the application launcher
 * - limit rate of events of your drivers (for example, calibrate buttons to send an event
 * at most every X ms)
